## Dart Foundations: Logic to Architecture
By Amos Emmanuel (sudo-melanin)

This repository documents my progression from core programming logic to advanced software architecture using the Dart language. These foundations serve as the engine for my upcoming native Flutter projects: Market Gist and FitLink..

## Technical Mastery Blocks

### 1. The Engine Room (Variables, Logic & Functions)
  Type Safety: Mastery of int, String, double, and sound type inference using var vs dynamic.
  Logic: Implementation of complex branching, relational operators, and switch statements.
  Functions: Utilizing arrow syntax (=>), named parameters, and closures for reusable logic.
  
### 2. Resilience & Data Handling (Null Safety & Loops)
  Sound Null Safety: Building crash-proof apps using ?, ??, ?., and !.
  Error Handling: Strategic use of try-catch-finally to manage system exceptions.
  Iteration: Advanced manipulation of List, Map, and Set using for-in and .forEach.

### 3. Advanced Architecture (OOP & Mixins)
  Abstraction & Inheritance: Designing modular systems with abstract classes and extends.
  Mixins: Implementing reusable "plug-in" behaviors across unrelated classes (e.g., Logger functionality).

#### Project: Inflation Engine — A reusable function to calculate price hikes across inventory.
#### Project: Project: FitLink Member Management — A multi-tier account hierarchy with unique permissions.

### 4. Reactive & Asynchronous Dart
  Generics: Building flexible, type-agnostic blueprints using <T> for server responses.
  Asynchrony: Handling one-time events with Future, async, and await.
  Streams: Managing real-time data pipes with async*, yield, and .listen().
  Enums: Utilizing enum for safe, constant state management and cleaner UI logic.

#### Project: The Resilient Checkout — A system that recovers from uninitialized data and "rescues" the app from crashing.
#### Project: Market Gist Search — Iterating through inventory to find specific items and calculating running totals.
#### Project: FitLink Member Management — A hierarchy of Free, Premium, and Trainer accounts with unique permissions and behaviors.

### Final Capstone 1: The Ultimate Checkout System
  The final project in this repository, ultimate_dart_capstone.dart, integrates all the above concepts into a single interactive program:
  OOP: Uses abstract classes for user management.
  Data Structures: Manages add-ons via Maps.
  Async Logic: Processes "bank payments" using Futures.
  Safety: Implements full error handling and nullable discount codes.

### Final Capstone 2: The Multi-Service Hub
  The final project, multi_service_hub.dart, is a powerhouse integration simulating a unified backend for e-commerce and fitness tracking:
  Live Background Streams for real-time market notifications.
  Generic Server Responses for flexible data handling.
  Mixin-based Logging for system transparency.
  Enum-driven Statuses for type-safe account management.
