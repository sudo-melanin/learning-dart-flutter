## Dart Foundations: The Road to Flutter
This repository is a comprehensive record of my journey through the 7 Pillars of Dart. It tracks my transition from understanding basic variables to architecting complex, asynchronous systems for real-world applications like Market Gist (E-commerce) and FitLink (Fitness Tracking).

## The 7 Blocks of Mastery

### 1. Variables & Data Types
  Concepts: Type safety (int, String, double), final vs const, and String interpolation.

### 2. Control Flow & Logic
  Concepts: if/else statements, relational operators, and logical branching.

### 3. Functions & Scope
  Concepts: Named vs Positional parameters, Arrow syntax (=>), and Global vs Local scope.

#### Project: Inflation Engine — A reusable function to calculate price hikes across inventory.

### 4. Null Safety & Error Handling
  Concepts: Nullable types (?), Null-aware operators (??, ?., !), and try-catch-finally blocks.

#### Project: The Resilient Checkout — A system that recovers from uninitialized data and "rescues" the app from crashing.

### 5. Loops & Iteration
Concepts: for, while, for-in, and .forEach for Maps.

#### Project: Market Gist Search — Iterating through inventory to find specific items and calculating running totals.

### 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Concepts: Abstract Classes, Inheritance (extends), Encapsulation (_private), and Polymorphism.

Project: FitLink Member Management — A hierarchy of Free, Premium, and Trainer accounts with unique permissions and behaviors.

### 7. Asynchronous Programming
Concepts: Future<T>, async, and await.

### Final Capstone: The Ultimate Checkout System
  The final project in this repository, ultimate_dart_capstone.dart, integrates all the above concepts into a single interactive program:
  OOP: Uses abstract classes for user management.
  Data Structures: Manages add-ons via Maps.
  Async Logic: Processes "bank payments" using Futures.
  Safety: Implements full error handling and nullable discount codes.
